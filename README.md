Simple ATM Simulation in C
This C program is a basic console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation that allows users to perform banking operations such as checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and transferring funds between accounts.

Features
User Authentication: Users are required to enter a password to access their account.
Account Operations:
Check Balance: View the current balance of the account.
Deposit: Add funds to the account.
Withdraw: Remove funds from the account, ensuring sufficient balance.
Transfer: Transfer funds from the account to another account.
Menu-Driven Interface: Users are presented with a menu of options to choose from.
Usage
Compile the Program:

bash
Copy code
gcc atm.c -o atm
Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
./atm
Follow On-Screen Instructions:

Enter the password to access the account.
Choose from the menu of options to perform desired banking operations.
Follow the prompts to complete each operation.
Security
Password Protection: Users must enter a password to access their account, enhancing security.
Input Validation: The program performs basic input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
Future Improvements
Multiple Accounts: Extend the program to support multiple user accounts with unique passwords and balances.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to handle edge cases and invalid inputs.
Transaction History: Add functionality to track transaction history for each account.
Encryption: Enhance security by encrypting sensitive data such as passwords and account balances.
